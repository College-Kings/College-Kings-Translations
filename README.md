# College Kings Translation Files

portuguese

### How to make a new language:
 - Create a new branch for your language, name it after your language and copy the base files from main.
 - This will be your language name and will stay throughout the translation.
 - Switch to the new branch.
 - In the new branch, replace the "DO NOT EDIT MAIN BRANCH" at the top of this file to the language name you chose earlier.
 - If you need help with anything else, just ask Jany on discord.

### How to start translating a new part:
 - Clone the github repository to your local pc.
 - Choose a file you want to translate from the table below and add your name to the "Who is working on it?" column.
 - Open the file and start filling the Empty brackets with the translation.

### How add a newly translated part:
 - Push it to the branch named after the language name from above.
 - Do **not** push it to the main branch.
 - Update your progress in the table below.
 - Remove your name from the table below. 
 - If you want to continue translating, jump to [the previous step](https://github.com/College-Kings/College-Kings-Translations#how-to-start-translating-a-new-part) again.

If you want to proofread your script again, there is a column for that as well, just place an x in the brackets. If you are alone and don't have the time for that, just skip that step for now.
