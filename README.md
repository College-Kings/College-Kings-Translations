CZECH

### How to make a new language:
 - Create a new branch for your language, name it after your language and copy the base files from main.
 - This will be your language name and will stay throughout the translation.
 - Switch to the new branch.
 - In the new branch, rename every "lang_base_translation" to the language name you chose earlier.
 - In the new branch, rename the folder "lang_base_translation" to the language name you chose earlier.
 - In the new branch, replace the "DO NOT EDIT MAIN BRANCH" at the top of this file to the language name you chose earlier.
 - If you need help with anything else, just ask Jany on discord.

### How to update your language:
 - Make a pull request from the main branch to your language branch.
 - If it doesn't merge automatically, contact Jany on discord.
 - If it does merge automatically, make sure to rename every "lang_base_translation" to the language name from above in the new files.
